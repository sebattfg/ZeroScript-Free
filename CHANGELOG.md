# Changelog

All notable changes to ZeroScript Free are documented here.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- Bridge no longer depends on Roblox's `mcp.bat`, which hard-coded a single
  Studio version path and broke (0 tools / "Bridge or Studio offline") once
  Studio auto-updated and that version folder was removed. A new
  `launch_studio_mcp.py` finds the newest installed `StudioMCP.exe` and launches
  it directly.
- `bridge.py` now runs a `.py` MCP command with the same Python interpreter as
  the bridge, so it works on installs where only the `py` launcher exists.

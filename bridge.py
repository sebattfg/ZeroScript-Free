#  ZeroScript Bridge
#  Local WebSocket <-> Roblox Studio MCP server.
#  The browser extension talks to this over ws://127.0.0.1:<PORT>.
#
#  What this bridge exposes to Kimi (aggregated into one tools/list):
#    - Every MCP server declared in config.json (by default: roblox), each
#      spawned as a stdio child and routed by tool name.
#
#  Design goals (robustness first):
#   - Each MCP stdio process is read by ONE dedicated thread; responses are
#     matched by JSON-RPC id (no "read the next line and hope" races).
#   - stderr is drained so a child never blocks on a full pipe.
#   - A dead server is auto-restarted and the failing call retried once.
#   - Tool calls are locked PER SERVER, so a slow server never blocks another.
#   - Every call ALWAYS produces a reply: a result OR a structured error.
#     Nothing ever hangs the agentic loop silently.
